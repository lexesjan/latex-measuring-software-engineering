\section{Introduction}
In this report I will explain the various ways in which one can measure the
software engineering process. I will outline what platforms or frameworks are
available to perform measurement. As well as, that I will go through the
algorithmic approaches and the ethic concerns surrounding the measurement of
the software engineering process.
